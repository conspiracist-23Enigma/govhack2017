		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<hr id= "introductionHR">
		<p> We are team FennerBoiz, a team consisting of Rahul Ghangas, Septian Razi, and Adonis Mutai. We all met at
		Fenner Hall, the residential hall where we all spent most of our time at. Studying a computer science degree in 
		one form or another at the Australian National University, we decided to register for GovHack 2017 to apply the skills
		we had learnt in our courses. </p>
		<p> Suburban is our main project for GovHack 2017. The story begins when we were all looking at government data and 
		brainstorming ideas. After viewing the various datasets from the ACT, we decided that most datasets can be correlated
		to one another with the location field. Then it popped into our heads. Suburban, a website that helps you visualise
		data on suburbs to help people choose where they would like to move. </p>
		<p> Using various data sets from Crime Statistics to primary school priority zones, our websites shows you the things that 
		matter in your potential suburb of residence. We, like all, would like to live where we all feel safe, can have fun and is 
		supported by others. With this tool, we hope that all residents of Canberra, new or old, can make the right decision in 
		choosing not only where their house is - but also where their home is.
